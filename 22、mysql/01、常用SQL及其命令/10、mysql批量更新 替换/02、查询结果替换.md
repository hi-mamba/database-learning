## [Using SELECT REPLACE with MySQL](https://www.electrictoolbox.com/mysql-select-replace/)

# 查询结果替换

## Basic usage

The REPLACE() function takes three parameters:

1. the string or column name to do the replacement on
2. what to look for
3. and what to replace it with

The following example replaces the 'aaa' part of 'aaa bbb ccc' with 'xyz' and 
the column returned from the SQL query will contain 'xyz bbb ccc':

Using SELECT REPLACE with MySQL

```mysql

SELECT REPLACE('aaa bbb ccc', 'aaa', 'xyz');
```

If you were doing this against the column "foo" you would do this instead:

```mysql
SELECT REPLACE(foo, 'aaa', 'xyz');
```
